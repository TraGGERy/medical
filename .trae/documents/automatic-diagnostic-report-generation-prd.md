## 3. Core Process

### Patient Flow
1. Patient engages in AI consultation conversation
2. System continuously analyzes conversation for completeness
3. When sufficient information is detected, AI suggests generating diagnostic report
4. Patient reviews suggestion and confirms or declines report generation
5. If confirmed, system displays progress indicators during generation
6. Generated report is presented in chat with download options
7. Patient can view detailed report or download for external use

### AI Provider Flow
1. AI provider analyzes ongoing conversation content
2. Evaluates information completeness using predefined criteria
3. Triggers report generation suggestion when threshold is met
4. Processes user confirmation and initiates report generation
5. Sends conversation data to Gemini API for diagnostic analysis
6. Receives and formats generated report for presentation
