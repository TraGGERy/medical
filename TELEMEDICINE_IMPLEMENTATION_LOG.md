   - `telemedicine_appointments` - Appointment management
   - `consultation_notes` - Medical consultation records
   - `provider_reviews` - Provider rating and feedback system
   - `prescriptions` - Digital prescription management

2. **Migration Generation**: Successfully generated migration file `0000_demonic_demogoblin.sql`
   - 23 total tables in database
   - 288 columns across all tables
   - 30 foreign key relationships
   - All telemedicine tables properly linked with existing user system

3. **Database Deployment**: Applied migration to database successfully
   - All tables created with proper constraints
   - Foreign key relationships established
   - Schema validation completed
