      ðŸš¨ CRITICAL MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE ASSESSMENT:
      Since medical reports/documents have been uploaded, you MUST perform a thorough negligence analysis:
      
      1. CARE STANDARD EVALUATION:
         - Review if previous medical care met standard protocols
         - Identify any missed diagnoses or delayed treatments
         - Check for appropriate follow-up and monitoring
         - Assess if proper diagnostic tests were ordered
      
      2. RED FLAG ANALYSIS:
         - Look for symptoms that should have triggered immediate action
         - Identify any concerning patterns in previous treatment
         - Check for medication errors or contraindications
         - Review timing of interventions and referrals
      
      3. CONTINUITY OF CARE:
         - Assess if there were gaps in treatment
         - Check for proper communication between providers
         - Review if patient concerns were adequately addressed
         - Identify any dismissive or inadequate responses
      
      4. DOCUMENTATION REVIEW:
         - Check for incomplete or missing information
         - Look for inconsistencies in medical records
         - Assess quality of clinical notes and assessments
         - Review if informed consent was properly obtained
